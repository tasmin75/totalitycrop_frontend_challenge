# Totality Corp Frontend Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Totality Corp Frontend Challenge. The challenge required developing an intermediate-level e-commerce website using React or a similar frontend framework/library. The website should replicate a shopping site with essential features, including product listing, cart management, and checkout. Additionally, the challenge called for a responsive design and optional user authentication.

## Features

### Product Listing

- Display a variety of products with images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- Implement filters to allow users to sort products by category, price range, or ratings.

### Shopping Cart

- Implement a cart section to display the added products, quantities, and total cost.
- Allow users to increase, decrease, or remove items from the cart.
- Display real-time updates of the cart total and item count.

### Checkout

- Implement a checkout process that calculates the total cost of items in the cart.
- Allow users to enter shipping information and payment details.

### Responsive Design

- Ensure the website is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Optimize the layout for different screen sizes.

### Additional Challenges (optional)

- User Authentication:
  - Provide user registration and login functionalities.
  - Display the user's name and avatar when logged in.

## Tech Stack

## Approach

I chose React as the frontend library/framework for this project to efficiently build the e-commerce website. I also utilized Redux-toolkit, Redux-persist for state management & enhance code quality and maintainability. For the user interface, I opted for the Material-UI (MUI) library to save time and ensure a polished and responsive design.
